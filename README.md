# VersionReaderTask
Azure DevOps / VSTS build task to read `<Version>` tag from project files and append Build numbers.

The task reads the `<Version>` tag from new `csproj` and `vbproj` 2017 format files into environment variables.

This tool was created to fix an issue with the new `.xxproj` project format. The new format does not support wildcard in the version and therefore auto-append of build suffix, which was previously supported.

Version 1.x runs as a PowerShell task and only works on windows build agents. Version 2.x has been rewritten in TypeScript and Node, so is now cross-platform. 

## Operation

The task will read the `<Version>` tag 0 if this isn't present it looks for `<VersionSuffix>` and then `<VersionPrefix>` values from the project if these are present. 

## Example Usage

The `VersionReaderTask` can be added after the build or the test task to extract the version details from the project. In the example below it runs after the test task and extracts the version from the `Ambolt.csproj` file.

The **Variables Prefix** setting can optionally be specified to differentiate the variable names, for example if you are running `VersionReaderTask` several times in a build. For example you might specify a prefix `DEMO_` for the Demo porject, and will result in the variables `DEMO_VERSION` and `DEMO_VERSION_BUILD`.

The **Build Prefix** is used to specify a separator between the version and the BuildID values - the default value is a dot `'.'` . For example, if the version is `1.2.3` and the build ID is `5678`, and no prefix is specified, `BUILD_VERSION` will be `1.2.35678`. If you specify `.` as the prefix, the `BUILD_VERSION` will be `1.2.3.5678`

The value is then used in a `dotnet pack` task as follows:

Note the **Automatic package versioning** is set to `Use an environment variable`
and the **Environment variable** is set to `VERSION_BUILD` value generated by the version reader task.

## Version History

### Version 2.0

Task rewritten in TypeScript so that it is cross-platform. Features and inputs are the same so it should be possible to just change the version for it to work in the same way as 1.x

### Version 1.15

Pull request [#5](https://github.com/conficient/versionReaderTask/pull/5) merged: Behaviour fixed so `Version` is checked first, then `AssemblyVersion`. If not present the `VersionPrefix` and `VersionSuffix` are checked instead. If `VersionPrefix` is not found, the default of **1.0.0** will be used. Thanks to [Sean Wright](https://github.com/seangwright) for the fix.

### Version 1.14

Added functionality to extract `VersionPrefix` and `VersionSuffix` if present, see [#4](https://github.com/conficient/versionReaderTask/issues/4).

### Version 1.13

Fixed version number in `task.json` - need to increment to update package.

### Version 1.12

Removed update in 1.11 - should have used BUILD PREFIX as . in the task. Also amended the logging to make it clearer exactly what values are being set.

### Version 1.11

Amended code to ensure version has a '.' at the end before the BUILDNO (fixed bug in v1.10)

### Version 1.9

Added `.Trim()` to version reads - can sometimes have space after the version tag.

### Version 1.8

Added fix for blank Version. Sometimes in simple projects the `Version` tag is absent because the value is the same as the `AssemblyVersion`. Added a check for a blank version being returned and attempts to use the `AssemblyVersion` value instead.
